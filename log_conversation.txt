user: The image are described as follows:
- The agent's color is blue, the target's color is red, and obstacles' color is green.
- Note that the image represents your surroundings and is not a graph.

You are responsible for determining the direction an agent should move based on its current position and the target position. Follow these guidelines:
- The agent must reach the target.
- As long as this conversation continues, the agent you control must continue to face the target.
- Respond with a single word: 'up', 'down', 'right', or 'left'. Do not use punctuation or extra explanations.
- Avoid any obstacles in the nearby area.
- The given coordinates are in the format (x, y), where the x-coordinate increases as you move to the right, and the y-coordinate increases as you move upward. 
- Path Planning: Consider the obstacles in the path and choose the direction that avoids them while still progressing towards the target.
- Directions 'up', 'down', 'right', or 'left' are fixed relative to the image, not relative to the agent's current orientation.
Agent position: (x, y) = (221.87, 300.00)
Target position: (x, y) = (150.00, 150.00)

Choose one word: 'up', 'down', 'left', or 'right'.
